Assignment:

Summary - The goal of your second assignment is the creation of a java GUI desktop application, that simulates the functionality of an online webshop.
The application should read the data of at least 60 products from a text file (name, price, category, quantity)

With the NetBeans GUI Editor, create a graphical interface for the following functions:
 - Show a list of all the products
 - The ability to search for products (not just the name of the product but all the fields)
 - Shopping Cart: Show Cart, Add and remove products to the cart, show the sum of price of products in the cart, complete the purchase.
 The user should be able to save products to file for later use.
 - Wishlist (with more or less the same functionality as the shopping cart): The user should be able to save products to file for later use.

Try to create a straightforward and efficient GUI, with multiple elements (JTextField, JList, JComboBox,JTextArea, perhaps JTable, etc.)
The project should also utilize multiple windows.
In the search function, the list of the products should automatically refresh, whenever the user types a new character.
The contents of the shopping cart and wishlist should be saved in separate files.
When the user completes a purchase, after inputting his card details and name, the application should remove the products from the main text file, and save them into new text file which contains the purchased items.

The use of database backends are forbidden for this project!
The project should be developed entirely in NetBeans.
The documentation should explain the role of the classes in the project, their functions and include screenshots of the  most important usage types.

The grading of the assignment depends on:
-the functionality of the application
-efficient usage of the rules of Object-Oriented programming
-efficient usage of Java Programming conventions (naming of classes and variables, code formatting)
