Sequential Access File

1.    Sequential Access to a data file ensures that the computer sequentially reads or writes the data to the file from file beginning and proceeds step by step.
2.    sequential access means that once the head reaches the position, the blocks are read from the same track one after another (in sequence).
3.    Sequential access has advantages when you access information in the same order all the time. Also is faster than random access.


Random Access file
1.    Random Access to a file means that the computer system can read or write information anywhere in the data file.
2.    Random access, though, means each block may be read from a different location, and the head(s) will have to be moved before reading each one, slowing down the performance significantly. This is the worst-case access pattern.
3.    Random access file has the advantage that you can search through it and find the data you need more easily (using indexing).
