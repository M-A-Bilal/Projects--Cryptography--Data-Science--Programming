ASSIGNMENT STATEMENT:

Write a program that inputs three different integers from the keyboard, then prints the sum, the average, the product, the smallest and the largest of these numbers. Use only the single-selection form of the if statement you learned.

The screen dialogue should appear as follows:

Enter three different integers: 13 27 14 
Sum is 54
Average is 18
Smallest is 13
Largest is 27
 

DELIVERABLES:

Submit ONLY one file that is a zip file which includes:

A Microsoft Visual Studio (VS 2019) project which includes the main directory of the project. The main directory will contain all the files and subdirectories created for the solution by MS VS.
A Microsoft Word Readme documentation file.
The FILES' NAMING FORMATS:  

Files' names should be in the following naming convention form: Last name-First initial-PA# where PA is the programming assignment number.

The Zip-file name (i.e.   Smith-J-PA03.zip)
The VS Project name (i.e.   Smith-J-PA03) ... The entire directory of the project should be submitted; NOT only the .lsn file.
The Readme file name (i.e.  Smith-J-PA03.doc)       (Readme is 25% of the grade if the project is working otherwise it is zero)
The SOURCE CODE (.c) file should include:

•  Comments to describe the code.

The README Documentation file should include a separate section for each of the following:

•   A front page that includes the university name, department name, the course title, assignment title, student name, and date.
•   A report which clearly describes the design and description of your software components. 
•   A description of any input data OR file(s) to test the application. (If a file is used include: a file with valid data and a file with invalid data)
•   A dataflow diagram for every function defined in the application using any diagramming/graphics software such as Microsoft Visio.
•   Screenshots of two execution sessions processing valid input data types.
