ArrayList is the implementation of List Interface where the elements can be dynamically added or removed from the list. 
Also, the size of the list is increased dynamically if the elements are added more than the initial size. 
Though it may be slower than standard arrays, it can be helpful in programs where lots of manipulation in the array is needed.

ArrayList in Java is used to store a dynamically sized collection of elements.
ArrayList is initialized by a size. However, the size can increase if the collection grows, and shrunk if objects are removed from the collection.
Java ArrayList allows us to randomly access the list.
